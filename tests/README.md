boost-cmake unit testing
========================

This folder contains unit tests for the boost-cmake infrastructure. Some of the files
here are inspired from their counterparts in the cmake.org project.

There exist different type of testing, but we are mostly interested in testing
the tools provided by the boost-cmake package.

Some of the interfaces to the test functions are definitely overkill wrt. what we need
to do in this project, but it is good to retain some level of compatibility with
the cmake project, that would promote some transfer to the original cmake.
